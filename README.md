# shapez2-monochrome-generator

This tool can convert any image to Shapez2 blueprint format and you can paste it in the game.

However, due to the limitations of the building colors, the tool currently only generates grayscale images. The default generated blueprint needs to be viewed from a high altitude. When the **trash placed on the platform turns black**, the optimal viewing distance is reached. Enabling the game's anti-aliasing option can provide a better visual experience. If you need to generate images for near-distance viewing, you can use **custom palette** to adapt near-distance building colors.
